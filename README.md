1.	Build Language (Kotlin DSL):
*	BUILD Files: Define build targets using Kotlin’s Domain Specific Language (DSL).
* Kotlin Scripts: Allow writing custom build rules and macros leveraging Kotlin’s capabilities.

2.	Dependency Graph Manager:
* Parses BUILD files to construct a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing dependencies between targets.
	
3. Execution Engine:
*	Schedules and executes build actions based on the dependency graph, supporting parallelism and caching.
  - task representation (build action as task)
  - dependency graph
  - scheduler
  - executor
  - caching mechanism
  - error handling and recovery
4.	Artifact Management:
*	Handles the storage and retrieval of build artifacts, supporting remote caching and distributed builds.

5.	Extensibility Layer:
*	Plugins and extensions written in Kotlin to support additional languages, tools, and custom build logic.
